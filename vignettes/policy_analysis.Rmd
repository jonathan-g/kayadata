# U.S. Nationally Defined Contribution to Paris Accord

The United States's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the 
2015 Paris climate accord committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions 
to 26--28% below 2005 levels by 2025 and
with a longer-term target of reducing emissions to 80% below 2005 levels
by 2050 [@us:indc.cover.note:2015].^[The Trump administration has announced
its intention to withdraw from the Paris accord. The analysis in this vignette
does not address that development and simply presents the implications of the 
pledged contribution.]
This vignette will compare what these goals imply for rates of 
improving energy efficiency and transitioning from fossil fuels to clean energy
sources.
The methods will follow Roger Pielke, Jr.'s approach for both bottom-up and
top-down analysis
[@pielke:tcf:2010; @pielke:uk.decarbonization:2009; @pielke:japan.decarbonization:2009; @pielke:australia.decarbonization:2011].

# Bottom-Up Analysis

Pielke's analysis rely on the Kaya identity:
$$
F = P \times g \times e \times f,
$$
where 

* _F_ is energy-related CO~2~ emissions (here, measured in billions of 
metric tons), 
* _P_ is the population in billions,
* _g_ is per-capita GDP (here, measured in thousands of dollars), 
* _e_ is the energy intensity of the economy (here, measured in quads of primary 
  energy consumed per trillion dollars of 
  GDP^[A quad is short for a quadrillion British Thermal Units.]),
* and _f_ is the carbon intensity of the energy supply (here, measured in 
  millions of metric tons of CO~2~ per quad).

Pielke begins his bottom-up analysis by examining projections of future 
population and per-capita GDP. In this vignette, I develop those projections
not from demographic and economic models, but simply by extrapolating from
recent trends.

## Recent Trends in Population and GDP

Begin by loading historical values of the Kaya identity parameters for the 
United States:
```{r load_data}
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(broom)
library(knitr)
library(kayadata)

kaya <- get_kaya_data("United States")
```
Let's start by looking at trends in _P_, _g_, _e_, and _f_ starting in 1990. 
I plot these with a log-scale on the y-axis because a constant growth rate
produces exponential growth, so it should look linear on a semi-log plot.

```{r plot_P_1990, fig.cap = str_c("Trend in population for U.S. from 1990--", max(kaya$year, na.rm = T))}
plot_kaya(kaya, "P", log_scale = TRUE, start_year = 1990, trend_line = TRUE, points = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r plot_g_1990, fig.cap = str_c("Trend in per-capita GDP for U.S. from 1990--", max(kaya$year, na.rm = T))}
plot_kaya(kaya, "g", log_scale = TRUE, start_year = 1990, trend_line = TRUE, points = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r plot_e_1990, fig.cap = str_c("Trend in primary-energy intensity of the U.S. economy from 1990--", max(kaya$year, na.rm = T))}
plot_kaya(kaya, "e", log_scale = TRUE, start_year = 1990, trend_line = TRUE, points = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

```{r plot_f_1990, fig.cap = str_c("Trend in the carbon-dioxide intensity of the U.S. energy supply from 1990--", max(kaya$year, na.rm = T))}
plot_kaya(kaya, "f", log_scale = TRUE, start_year = 1990, trend_line = TRUE, points = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

All of these trends look reasonable, except for _f_. Let's try _f_ again, but fitting the trend only since 2005:

```{r plot_f_2005, fig.cap = str_c("Trend in the carbon-dioxide intensity of the U.S. energy supply from 2005--", max(kaya$year, na.rm = T))}
plot_kaya(kaya, "f", log_scale = TRUE, start_year = 2005, trend_line = TRUE, points = FALSE) +
  theme_bw()
```

That looks better. The abrupt changes in trend at 1990 and again at 2005 illustrate the difficulties of predicting future values by extrapolating from past trends, and indicates that the extrapolations we will use here should be taken with several grains of salt.

### Historical Trends

Now let's calculate the historical trends:
```{r compute-bottom-up-rates}
vars <- c("P", "g", "e", "f")
historical_trends <- map_dbl(vars, 
                 ~kaya %>% 
                   gather(key = variable, value = value, -region, -year) %>%
                   filter(variable == .x, 
                          year >= ifelse(.x == "f", 2005, 1990)) %>%
                   lm(log(value) ~ year, data = .) %>% tidy() %>%
                   filter(term == "year") %$% estimate
) %>% set_names(vars)

tibble(Variable = names(historical_trends), 
       Rate = map_chr(historical_trends, ~sprintf("%.02f%%", 100 * .x))) %>%
  kable(align = c("c", "r"))
```

## Implied Decarbonization Rates

Next, calculate the implied rate of change of _F_ under the policy. This is 
not an extrapolation from history, but a pure implication of the policy goals:
From the Kaya identity, $F = G \times e \times f$, so the rates of change are
$r_F = r_G + r_e + r_f = r_G + r_{ef}$. From this, the rate of 
decarbonization of the economy is given by $r_{ef} = r_F - r_G$.
Here, $r_F$ is the rate of emissions-reduction implied by the policy and
$r_G$ is the rate of growth of the GDP, which we extrapolated from historical
trends.

```{r implied_rate_F}
ref_year <- 2005
target_years <- c(2025, 2050)
target_reduction <- c(0.26, 0.80)

F_ref <- kaya %>% filter(year == ref_year) %$% F
F_target <- tibble(year = target_years, F = F_ref * (1 - target_reduction)) %>%
  mutate(implied_rate = log(F / F_ref) / (year - ref_year))

F_target %>% 
  mutate(implied_rate = map_chr(implied_rate, ~sprintf("%.02f%%", 100 * .x))) %>%
  rename("Target F" = F, "Implied Rate" = implied_rate) %>%
  kable(align = c("crr"), digits = 0)
```

Now we have everything we need for a bottom-up analysis of the implied 
rates of decarbonization:
```{r implied_decarb_bottom_up}
implied_decarb_rates <- F_target %>% 
  transmute(year, impl_F = implied_rate, 
            hist_G = historical_trends['P'] + historical_trends['g'],
            hist_ef = historical_trends['e'] + historical_trends['f'],
            impl_ef = impl_F - hist_G)

implied_decarb_rates %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("hist_"), starts_with("impl_")),
            funs(map_chr(., ~sprintf("%.02f%%", 100 * .x)))) %>%
  select(Year = year, 
         "implied F" = impl_F, 
         "historical G" = hist_G,
         "implied ef" = impl_ef, 
         "historical ef" = hist_ef
  ) %>%
  kable(align="rrrrr")
```

## Results

To meet the goals for `r target_years[1]` would require increasing the rate
of reducing _ef_ from 
`r (100 * filter(implied_decarb_rates, year == target_years[1])$hist_ef) %>% 
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 2)`% per year
to 
`r (100 * filter(implied_decarb_rates, year == target_years[1])$impl_ef) %>% 
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 2)`% per year:
`r filter(implied_decarb_rates, year == target_years[1]) %>% 
         transmute(ratio = impl_ef / hist_ef) %$% ratio %>%
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 1)` times faster.
  

To meet the goals for `r target_years[2]` would require increasing the rate
of reducing _ef_ from 
`r (100 * filter(implied_decarb_rates, year == target_years[2])$hist_ef) %>% 
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 2)`% per year
to 
`r (100 * filter(implied_decarb_rates, year == target_years[2])$impl_ef) %>% 
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 2)`% per year:
`r filter(implied_decarb_rates, year == target_years[2]) %>% 
         transmute(ratio = impl_ef / hist_ef) %$% ratio %>%
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 1)` times faster.

# Top-Down Analysis

The top-down analysis is very similar to the bottom-up analysis, but instead
of looking at the elements of the Kaya identity individually, we use 
predictions from macroeconomic integrated assessment models that consider 
interactions between population, GDP, and energy use to predict future energy
demand:
```{r top_down_trends}
top_down_trends <- get_top_down_trends("United States")

top_down_trends %>% select(P, G, E) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(map_chr(., ~sprintf("%.02f%%", 100 * .x)))) %>%
  rename("P trend" = P, "G trend" = G, "E trend" = E) %>%
  kable(align="rrr")
```

## Implied Decarbonization

In the bottom-up analysis, we calculated the implied rate of decarbonizing the
economy by comparing the rate of emissions reduction implied by the policy
($r_F$) to the 
predicted rate of change of GDP ($r_G$).
Here, in the top-down analysis, we calculate the implied rate of decarbonizing
the energy supply ($r_f$) by comparing the rate of emissions-reduction implied
by policy ($r_F$) to the predicted rate of growth of energy demand ($r_E$):
$F = E \times f$, so $r_F = r_E + r_f$, which we rearrange to find that
$r_f = r_F - r_E$.
```{r implied_decarb_top_down}
implied_decarb_rates_top_down <- F_target %>% 
  transmute(year, impl_F = implied_rate, 
            top_down_E = top_down_trends$E,
            hist_f = historical_trends['f'],
            impl_f = impl_F - top_down_E)

implied_decarb_rates_top_down %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("hist_"), starts_with("impl_"), 
                 starts_with("top_down")),
            funs(map_chr(., ~sprintf("%.02f%%", 100 * .x)))) %>%
  select(Year = year, 
         "implied F" = impl_F, 
         "top-down E" = top_down_E,
         "implied f" = impl_f, 
         "historical f" = hist_f
  ) %>%
  kable(align="rrrrr")
```

## Results

To meet the goals for `r target_years[1]` would require increasing the rate
of reducing _f_ from 
`r (100 * filter(implied_decarb_rates_top_down, 
                 year == target_years[1])$hist_f) %>% 
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 2)`% per year
to 
`r (100 * filter(implied_decarb_rates_top_down, 
                 year == target_years[1])$impl_f) %>% 
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 2)`% per year:
`r filter(implied_decarb_rates_top_down, 
          year == target_years[1]) %>% 
         transmute(ratio = impl_f / hist_f) %$% ratio %>%
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 1)` times faster.
  

To meet the goals for `r target_years[2]` would require increasing the rate
of reducing _f_ from 
`r (100 * filter(implied_decarb_rates_top_down, 
                 year == target_years[2])$hist_f) %>% 
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 2)`% per year
to 
`r (100 * filter(implied_decarb_rates_top_down, 
                 year == target_years[2])$impl_f) %>% 
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 2)`% per year:
`r filter(implied_decarb_rates_top_down, 
          year == target_years[2]) %>% 
         transmute(ratio = impl_f / hist_f) %$% ratio %>%
   formatC(format = "f", digits = 1)` times faster.
