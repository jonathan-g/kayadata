#'
#' kayadata is a package for working with Kaya identity data for many countries
#' and regions.
#'
#' The Kaya identity, named for the economist Yoichi Kaya, who introduced it
#' (Kaya, 1998); It decomposes the energy-related carbon dioxide emissions from
#' a nation, region, or the world into the product of four components:
#' \deqn{F = P \times g \times e \times f,}{F = P * g * e * f}
#' where _F_ is the total emissions, _P_ is the population, _g_ is the
#' per-capita GDP, _e_ is the energy intensity of the economy, and
#' _f_ is the emissions-intensity of the energy supply.
#' (Nakicenovic and Swart, 2000,
#' [Ch. 3, p. 105](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/emissions-scenarios/);
#' Raupach _et al_, 2007)
#'
#'
#' The data in this packages covers 1960-2019 for population and GDP, and
#' 1965-2019 for energy and fossil-fuel CO2 emissions.
#'
#' The package uses data on population and GDP from the World Bank,
#' using market exchange rates (MER) for GDP because those data go back to
#' 1960. From 1990 onward, Purchasing-Power-Parity (PPP) GDP figures are
#' available as `G_ppp` but using these would require re-calculating
#' `G`, `g`, `e`, and `ef` in the `kaya_data`
#' data frame.
#'
#' The package uses data on energy consumption and fossil-fuel CO2 emissions
#' from the
#' [2021 BP Statistical Review of World Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html)

#' Aggregate regional data
#'
#' Problems with aggregate regional data
#'
#' The World Bank is missing GDP data for a number of nations, such as Syria
#' and Taiwan.  Because of this and the incommensurability between the regions
#' used for aggregate statistics in the World Bank data and the BP data,
#' aggregate regional data (e.g., for the Middle East and Africa) should be
#' treated with caution.
#
#' This problem does not hold for individual nations, where missing data
#' appears as `NA` values.
