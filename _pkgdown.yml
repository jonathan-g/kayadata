  title: Kaya Identity Data for Nations and Regions
  description: >
    Provides data for Kaya identity variables (population, gross
    domestic product, primary energy consumption, and energy-related
    CO2 emissions) for the world and for individual nations, and
    utility functions for looking up data,  plotting trends of
    Kaya variables, and plotting the fuel mix for a given country
    or region. The Kaya identity (Yoichi Kaya and Keiichi Yokobori,
    "Environment, Energy, and Economy: Strategies for Sustainability"
    (United Nations University Press, 1998) and
    <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaya_identity>) expresses a nation's
    or region's greenhouse gas emissions in terms of its population,
    per-capita Gross Domestic Product, the energy intensity of its
    economy, and the carbon-intensity of its energy supply.
