# kayadata 1.4.0

* Update data through 2023:
  * The 2024 release of the Energy Statistics Report.
  * The latest population and GDP data from the World Bank.
  * Cleaned up some code to avoid importing more global symbols than necesssary
    from Imported packages, and to fix calls to dependency libraries that had
    become deprecated or raised warnings.

# kayadata 1.3.0

* Update data through 2022:
  * The 2023 release of Energy Statistics (which moved from BP to the 
    Energy Institute)
    * The new data has some small discrepancies (around 2--3 percent) between 
      the sum of primary energy consumption by fuel and the total primary energy 
      consumption for Hong Kong and Sri Lanka. See documentation for
      `fuel_mix` for details.
  * The latest population and GDP data from the World Bank.

# kayadata 1.2.0

* Update data through 2021:
  * The 2022 release of BP Energy Statistics.
  * The latest population and GDP data from the World Bank.

# kayadata 1.1.0

* Add optional arguments to `plot_kaya()` to allow the user to specify the 
  line and point sizes for the plot.

# kayadata 1.0.0

The package has matured and this will be release 1.0.0.

* This release updates to data through 2020:
  * The 2021 release of BP Energy Statistics
  * The latest population and GDP data from the World Bank.


# kayadata 0.5.1

This release is a bugfix

* Provide return value from `emissions_factors()`

# kayadata 0.5.0

This release updates to use the 2020 release of BP Energy Statistics. This
release has data through 2019.

* The World Bank is missing GDP data for a number of nations, such as Syria and 
  Taiwan. Because of this and the  incommensurability of the regions used for 
  aggregate statistics in the World Bank data and the BP data, regional data 
  should be treated with caution. 

  This problem does not hold for individual nations, where missing data appears 
  as NA values.
* Fix a bug where `testthat` tests would throw errors on systems where the 
  suggested `vdiffr` package cannot be installed.
  The package now passes `R CMD check` with the environment variable
  `_R_CHECK_DEPENDS_ONLY_` set to `TRUE`.
  

# kayadata 0.4.4

This release is a minor bug fix. 

* Previously there hadn't been an emissions 
  factor for hydroelectricity if renewables were not collapsed in the fuel mix.
  Now there's a factor for hydro if `emissions_factors()` is called with 
  `collapse_renewables = FALSE`.

# kayadata 0.4.3 

This release is mostly a bug fix for changes in the way that the latest releases
of `ggplot2` and `scales` packages handle color names.

* Fix color in `plot_kaya`. Since `scales` v. 1.1.0, `ggplot2` no longer 
  recognizes `"dark blue"` as a color (now it must be `"darkblue"`).
* Add visual regression tests for plotting functions (using `vdiffr`).
* Add optional arguments to plotting functions to override default colors.
* Add documentation site on GitHub Pages via `pkgdown`.
* Add code of conduct and guidelines for contributing.
